        <h2>Late Work</h2>
        <p>
          Weekly assignments are expected to be completed on-time. It is important that you practice what you learn on a weekly basis in order to keep up with the material. To support this and to allow discussion of assignments in-class, this work is not accepted. However, I do understand that life happens, and your lowest weekly assignment score will be dropped to account for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project assignment are longer duration assignments and it is expected that you will manage the time to allow life to happen while still completing the work on time. As these are smaller in number and thus each one a larger part of your grade, these assignments have a small late window where they may still be submitted for reduced credit. However each calendar day the project is late will drop the score earned by 10%. Thus, you may want to carefully consider whether it is better to turn in what you have on time or take the extra time to complete the work for reduced credit.
